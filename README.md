# Tensile-strength-testing-device-for-thin-films
A low-cost Universal Testing Machine (UTM) for material characterization through tensile testing. Uses a stepper motor and load cell to measure force and displacement, with a Python Tkinter GUI for control and real-time stress-strain visualization. Supports speeds of 1.0-8.0 mm/min and a max load of 50N. Ideal for research and education.
